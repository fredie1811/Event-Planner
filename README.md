Description:
The Event Calendar application is a robust web-based tool designed to help users manage and track various events, including birthdays, anniversaries, football matches, and miscellaneous occasions. Built using Flask for backend functionality, Bootstrap for responsive design, and custom CSS and JavaScript for additional styling and interactivity, this project serves as a comprehensive solution for organizing personal and public events.

The application features an intuitive interface with a calendar view, allowing users to view and manage their events seamlessly. Users can add events dynamically, modify the date via a form, and even delete events that are no longer relevant. Additionally, the project includes pages for event details, contact information, and authentication for secure access.

I chose to make this project as I have always struggled with the available calandar task management applications' user interface, and decided to make one of my own.

Project Files and Their Functionality: A) layout.html This file serves as the base template for the application, implementing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by providing a consistent structure for all pages. It contains: i) Navigation Bar: A responsive navbar with links for authentication, home, events, and contact pages. The navbar changes dynamically based on user session status. ii) Main Sections: Divided into left, middle, and right blocks, allowing individual pages to customize content while maintaining a common layout. iii) Styles and Scripts: Links to Bootstrap, custom CSS files, and JavaScript for smooth functionality. A significant decision was to use Flask's templating engine to create dynamic pages. The layout.html file provides a consistent structure across the application, while child templates like index.html and events.html allow for tailored content. This approach simplifies maintenance and improves scalability

B)index.html The index.html file is the primary view that displays the calendar and highlights the core functionality of the application. Key features include: i) Dynamic Calendar Rendering: A table structure that displays days of the month. Current dates are highlighted, and users can interact with specific days. A calander type input on the top right allowers used to quickly navigate to different months or years, ii)Event Types: Divided into left (birthdays and anniversaries) and right (football matches and miscellaneous) panels for better organization. iii)Event Modal: A Bootstrap modal for adding events. Users can select event types, provide descriptions, and submit details using a dynamically updated form. While displaying Birthdays, Anniversaries and Miscallenous events, we use only the date and month as we felt that these were the only two pieces of data that were really required, unlike a for a football game where its important to know which year it is just to understand whether you're referring to an old game that you forgot to clear.

C)events.html This page provides a detailed view of all events categorized by type. It includes: i)Table Layout: Displays each event with its date and description, allowing users to quickly find details. ii)Delete Functionality: Each event has a delete button that lets users remove entries from the list dynamically. Forms are pre-configured to handle the deletion via Flask routes.

D)contact.html The contact page offers a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for users to get in touch with the creator (aka me) to suggest improvements of any kind in the application. Features include: i)Contact Information: Includes my phone number, Instagram handle, and email link. ii)CTA Button: Encourages users to send an email directly via a clickable button.

E)login.html/register.html The first page that loads when you first open the application. It allows users to register and create accounts to store their data onto. Features include: i) Responsive Layout: The login form is structured to be flexible and adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal usability across devices, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile views. ii) User Feedback: If an error occurs during the login attempt (e.g., incorrect credentials), the page displays a message informing the user of the issue. The message is color-coded to provide clear visual feedback. If the login is successful, a green confirmation message is shown; if unsuccessful, a red message is displayed. This allows users to easily identify the result of their login attempt.

F)JavaScript (selection.js) This file is responsible for dynamic functionalities such as: i) Updating the event modal form based on the selected event type. ii) Enhancing user experience with interactivity and form validation. I could've probably done this using Flask itself using multiple paths, but in the end it made more sense to do it in Javascript for the sake of code simplicity and to learn a little bit more Javascript.

G) events.db This is the database for storing mainly: i) The different users on the applications (in a table called users) This table has columns for their ID (A primary Key), their username and their hashed password ii) The different events entered by each user (in a table called events) This table has columns for the event ID (A primary key), user_id (a foreign key), the event type, its date, month, year and finally for the event's description.

To conclude The Event Calendar application is a comprehensive project designed with both functionality and user experience in mind. Its modular structure, dynamic rendering, and clean design make it a practical tool for event management. The thoughtful categorization of files and use of Flask's templating engine allow for easy scalability and maintenance.
